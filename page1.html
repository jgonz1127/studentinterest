            <p class="mbr-text py-3 mbr-fonts-style display-5">Learning is an essential part within any student. It is vital that students receive the necessary information that could be beneficial beyond a learning environment. When students aren’t able to learn based off a certain mindset about school, it hinders their ability to learn. While many factors can come into play that may affect a student’s mindset about learning in general, it has shown that teachers are a main factor in inspiring their students to learn.
<br>
<br>Teachers are the leading factor in a student’s thought about learning. Facts have shown that teachers influence the attitudes of students whether they support school or not. Based on studies done to see the reason behind a disturbance with students and learning, it showed that teachers who took the time to care about the welfare of their students and properly teach the material saw more students engaged in the material being taught. Studies have shown that motivated teachers are very crucial in a classroom environment. Their attitudes and behaviours can leave a huge impact on a student.  
<br>
<br>At the same time, students have displayed their views of learning and how teachers are an important factor to why they enjoy school. In a questionnaire to students, those who liked their teachers followed a reward system, where good tasks led to rewards. Students who disliked their teachers didn’t have the motives to learn since they never received any reward in return. Students want something in return, if they receive something in return that is beneficial, it gives them a motive to learn. This goes to show that teachers who put the effort in their methods of teaching can help their students stay motivated. 
<br>
<br>If teachers and students have a connective bond, it means that both will strive in the end. Students will be inspired to learn and attend school for those reasons and teachers will be willing to take the opportunity to learn and care for their students for them to learn. As stated previously, teachers are a main factor in learning, it’s a fact.&nbsp;<br></p>
